# iss-notifier
This program notifies you when the ISS is in a certain location by sending an email. It demonstrates making an API request, getting a response and working with the response data.
We get the sunrise and sunset data and check if the ISS is above the sky at night, as it will be visible. If so, this sends an email to myself as a notification. 
The code runs every 60 seconds.
